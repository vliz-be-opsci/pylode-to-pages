It may be restricted to the tip of the snout if the lower jaw projects. The base of the caudal fin (end of the vertebral column or posterior edge of the hypural plate) is determined by flexing the tail up while the caudal peduncle is held down. The resultant wrinkle or caudal flexure indicates the caudal base. It may also be determined by probing or dissection. Sometimes the posteriormost point is the last scale, the last pored scale or the beginning of the caudal fin rays. It is the usual scientific measurement for length of a fish except in Myxini, Petromyzontiformes, Elasmobranchii and Holocephali. This measurement is used because long-preserved fish often lose the tips of the caudal fin rays through breakage after the desiccation effect of alcohol. See total length and fork length. In Holocephali the length is usually taken from the tip of the snout to the origin of the upper caudal fin because the caudal filament breaks off frequently. In Scaridae it is taken back to the rear margin of the second to last lateral line scale {because the large scales obscure the point of caudal flexure. In small dead fish, the end point is detected by bending the caudal fin to one side. In fishery work, as a result of the use of the measuring board, standard-, fork- and total length are taken from the most anterior part of the head. Abbreviated as SL.",,

Sometimes, when there are two equal lobes, the caudal rays are squeezed together and their tip is taken as the most posterior point (excluding the caudal filaments), or the longest lobe is squeezed to the midline (maximum length or extreme tip length). Also an imaginary line may be drawn between the two lobe tips and length to its mid-point taken as the most posterior point (total auxiliary length or bilobular length). Usually the tip of the most posterior lobe of the fin in normal position is taken as the posteriormost point (total normal length or natural tip length). Total length is used by taxonomists in Myxini, Petromyzontiformes, usually in Elasmobranchii and sometimes in other fishes. Standard length is usually employed with Teleostei. Abbreviated TL.",,
